				<p>Hello my name is Elizabeth and this is my fruit tree. I call him Peter Pearker. I decided to harvest a pear tree because pears are my favourite fruit and I add it to many of my recipes.</p> 
				<p>I’ve been growing this tree for about 8 months now. and surprisingly, this tree has grown so big so suddenly, to the point that I needed help picking the fruits off the ground, around the tree. and high up in the tree.</p>
				<p>I heard about this organization through a friend who also grows a fruit tree of her own. She explained to me that this organization will bring a few volunteers over to pick the fruits from my tree in places I can’t reach. A third of the fruits picked will be given to me, another third will be for the volunteers and another third of the fruits will be given to local food banks and charity events.</p>
				<p>This is a great organization and I appreciate what you guys do, for if it wasn’t for Not Far From The Tree, I don’t know how I would get those fruits picked.</p>
				<p>Thank you.</p><br/>

				<p>Hello my name is Michael and I have been associated with Not far from the tree for almost 2 years now. I am the owner of an apple tree and due to my injuries, I do not have the strength and energy to pick the apples off of the tree.</p>
				<p>I heared about Not Far From The Tree in the local paper and what impressed me the most about this organization was the fact that they share the harvest they picked in three different ways, 1/3 to me the tree owner, 1/3 to the volunteers and 1/3 to local shelters and food banks. Its good to know that the no harvest goes to waste .</p>
				<p>The first time having the volunteers over was great. They were a hard working bunch of peopple that take their ‘job’ very seriously. As you can see in my picture, the organization helps out very much. I am glad I got involved with this organization. I will continue to stay in touch with the organization and the volunteers.</p><br/>
